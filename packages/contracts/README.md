# Superfluid Stream Tokenizer Powered by ACL

# Synopsis

The NFT Flow Tokenizer (The “Niflot”) introduces a smart contract that can be permissioned to manage a Superfluid compensation stream to mint NFTs that tokenize the compensation streams for fixed durations.

“Tokenizing a Superfluid salary” refers to creating a NFT whose holder receives the compensation stream. If that NFT is transferred to another address, that new address begins receiving the salary stream.

By tokenizing compensation streams, we can tap into the ability to trade them. Imagine purchasing a month’s worth of a receiver’s compensation stream upfront and pricing that as an asset.
